python hashlib

* md5 - Message Digest Algorithm 5 - hash function takes an input message of arbitrary length and produces a fixed-size 128-bit hash value

* md5 is a cryptographic hash function, used to create a unique fixed-size hash for any given input. Each unique input is supposed to produce a unique hash.

* However, due to vulnerabilities discovered over time, MD5 is considered weak, with known collision attcks. Collisions occur when two different inputs produce the same hash. undermining the security of the algorithm. Due to its vulnerabilities, MD5 is deprecated for security purposes. More secure hash functions like SHA-256 or SHA-3 are preferred for cryptographic applications.
